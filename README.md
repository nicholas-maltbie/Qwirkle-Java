# Qwirkle Java Project

Example project to re-create the Qwirkle project as a high school project from 2014-2016.

These projects were part of a set of various java projects that I had worked on with other students in the intro to CS
classes. here is a reference to the other projected linked from the
[Java Projects](https://nickmaltbie.com/blog/2014/04/01/Java-Projects.html) page on my website: [Java Projects Google
Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0gCZqueOMVIal9IWGcyTjdidFE?resourcekey=0-daIvDUIgA1FJPzxrSYR_sA&usp=sharing).

These projects were made before I knew how to use git so they are a bit messy and low on communication and
documentation.
